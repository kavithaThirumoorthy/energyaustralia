Introduction:
I have solved this problem using spring boot rest API with java 8. The output is played in a web page both as html content and JSON. So two API URLs are exposed.
http://localhost:8080/musicFestival/recordLabelInfo
http://localhost:8080/musicFestival/recordLabelInfostr

Deploy and run:
Since it is spring boot, it has in build tomcat.
1. First download jar file from  https://github.com/kavithaThirumoorthy/energyaustralia/tree/master/SolutionCode/target/musicfestival.jar
2. Need to run jar file by following command,
java -jar musicfestival.jar.
3. Java should be installed and it should be added in environment variable.
